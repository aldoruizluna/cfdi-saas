# Developer Guides

This section contains essential information for developers contributing to or working with the codebase of the SaaS platform.

## Guides

*   **[`local-setup.md`](./local-setup.md):** Detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up the complete development environment on your local machine (cloning, dependencies, environment variables, running services via Docker Compose).
*   **[`coding-standards.md`](./coding-standards.md):** Guidelines on code formatting (linters, formatters), naming conventions, programming best practices, and patterns specific to the project's technology stack (e.g., NestJS patterns, React best practices).
*   **[`contribution-guidelines.md`](./contribution-guidelines.md):** The process for contributing code, including:
    *   Branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow variant).
    *   Pull Request (PR) process requirements (description templates, reviewers, CI checks).
    *   Commit message conventions.
    *   Issue tracking workflow (linking PRs to issues).
*   **Testing Strategy:** (To be created) Overview of the testing approach, including unit testing, integration testing, contract testing (if used), and end-to-end testing frameworks and conventions.
*   **Debugging Guide:** (To be created) Tips and techniques for debugging backend services and the frontend application within the local Docker environment.
*   **Deployment Process:** (To be created) Explanation of how code gets from a merged PR to the staging and production environments (CI/CD pipeline overview).
*   **Working with Microservices:** (To be created) Guidance on inter-service communication patterns, error handling across services, and managing shared dependencies or types.

Ensure you are familiar with the local setup and contribution guidelines before starting development work. Refer to the coding standards regularly.
