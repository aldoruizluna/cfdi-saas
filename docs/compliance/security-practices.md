# Security Practices Overview

This document outlines the key security measures and practices implemented within the SaaS platform to protect user data and ensure system integrity.

## Authentication & Authorization

*   **Strong Authentication:**
    *   Password hashing using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) with adequate salt rounds.
    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enforced or strongly recommended (using TOTP apps).
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   Users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, User, Approver).
    *   Permissions are granted based on roles, restricting access to features and data accordingly. Authorization checks are performed in relevant backend services.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   Use of secure, short-lived access tokens (JWT) with secure refresh token mechanisms.
    *   Secure handling of tokens on the frontend (e.g., storing in memory or secure browser storage with appropriate flags).

## Data Security

*   **Encryption in Transit:**
    *   All external communication (user browser to API Gateway, API Gateway to external services like PAC) uses TLS 1.2 or higher (HTTPS).
    *   Internal service-to-service communication within the cluster should also ideally use TLS (mTLS).
*   **Encryption at Rest:**
    *   Sensitive data stored in databases (e.g., user credentials, PAC API keys, potentially some PII) is encrypted using standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
    *   Cloud provider features for database and storage encryption (e.g., AWS RDS encryption, S3 server-side encryption) are enabled.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   API keys, database passwords, JWT secrets, and other sensitive credentials are not hardcoded in source code.
    *   They are managed securely using environment variables injected at runtime, ideally sourced from a secrets management system (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets with KMS integration).
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Rigorous input validation is performed on all data received from clients (frontend, API consumers) to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.). This occurs at the API Gateway layer and/or within individual microservices.
*   **Fiscal Document Security:**
    *   CFDI XML files (containing digital seals) are stored securely (e.g., S3 with restricted access policies). Access is logged.

## Infrastructure Security

*   **Cloud Security:**
    *   Leveraging cloud provider security features (e.g., AWS Security Groups/NACLs, IAM roles with least privilege).
    *   Regular security patching of underlying infrastructure and operating systems.
*   **Container Security:**
    *   Using minimal base Docker images.
    *   Scanning container images for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using AWS ECR scanning, Snyk, Trivy).
    *   Running containers with non-root users where possible.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   Network segmentation (e.g., using VPCs, subnets, security groups) to isolate services.
    *   Restricting public access only to necessary endpoints (API Gateway, frontend hosting).
*   **Rate Limiting & WAF:**
    *   Implementing rate limiting at the API Gateway to prevent DoS attacks.
    *   Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) (e.g., AWS WAF, Cloudflare) to filter malicious traffic (SQLi, XSS attempts).

## Development Lifecycle (DevSecOps)

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Linters and security-focused static analysis tools integrated into the CI pipeline.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scanning project dependencies (npm packages, etc.) for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk).
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** (Optional) Running automated DAST scans against staging environments.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Periodic manual penetration testing conducted by security professionals.
*   **Code Reviews:** Security considerations are part of the standard code review process.

## Logging & Monitoring

*   Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events (logins, failed logins, access attempts, key actions).
*   Centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, AWS CloudWatch Logs, Datadog).
*   Monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities or security events.

This overview is not exhaustive. Security is an ongoing process requiring continuous monitoring, updating, and adaptation to new threats.
