    *   **(Optional) Project/Client:** Assign the expense to a specific project or client if applicable.

    *   You might have options to "Save as Draft" or "Submit for Approval".
    *   If you save as draft, you can edit it later before submitting.
    *   Click "Submit for Approval" to send it into the workflow.

## Viewing and Tracking Expenses

*   Go to the "Expenses" or "Consultar Gastos" section.
*   You will see a list of expenses you have submitted or drafted.
*   Use filters (by Status, Date Range, Category) to narrow down the list.
*   The **Status** column indicates the current state of your expense:
    *   **Draft:** Saved but not submitted.
    *   **Submitted / Pending Approval:** Sent for review, awaiting action from an approver.
    *   **Approved:** The expense has been approved.
    *   **Rejected:** The expense was rejected (check comments for reasons).
    *   **Reimbursed:** (If applicable) The expense has been paid back.
*   Click on an expense to view its full details, including any comments from approvers and the attached receipt.

## Editing or Deleting Expenses

*   You can typically only edit or delete expenses that are in **Draft** status.
*   Find the draft expense, and look for an "Edit" or "Delete" option.
*   Once submitted, expenses usually cannot be edited directly by the submitter. You may need to request a rejection if changes are needed.

## (For Approvers) Reviewing Expenses

1.  Navigate to the "Approvals" or "Gastos Pendientes" section.
2.  You will see a list of expenses awaiting your review.
3.  Click on an expense to view its details and the attached receipt.

5.  **Actions:**
    *   **Approve:** Click the "Approve" button if the expense is valid.
    *   **Reject:** Click the "Reject" button if the expense is invalid or needs correction. You will likely be required to provide a reason/comment for the rejection, which the submitter will see.
