# Software Specifications: SaaS Invoicing & Expense Management Platform with MCP Integration

## 1. Overview

This document details the functional and technical specifications for a cloud-based (SaaS) platform. The system provides:

*   **Electronic Invoicing:** Emitting CFDI-compliant invoices per Mexican fiscal regulations (CFDI 4.0).
*   **Expense Management:** Recording, approving, and analyzing business expenditures.
*   **Integration Capabilities:** Via Modular Connection Protocol (MCP) connections to work with automation tools such as n8n, alongside traditional REST APIs and Webhooks.

The solution is developed both for internal use and for offering as a service to other businesses, ensuring ease of use, minimal required interactions, robust security, and strict compliance with Mexican tax norms (SAT).

## 2. Scope of the System

### 2.1 Modules

#### A. Invoicing Module (CFDI Manager)

*   **Invoice Generation:**
    *   Provide a guided, user-friendly wizard for creating electronic invoices (CFDI version 4.0 compliant).
    *   Auto-validate mandatory fields (RFC, regimen fiscal, UsoCFDI, DomicilioFiscalReceptor, ObjetoImp, etc.) and prevent submission if errors exist, based on SAT requirements.
*   **Timbrado & Certification:**
    *   Integrate with approved PACs (Proveedores Autorizados de Certificación) through secure API endpoints (REST/SOAP) to send pre-invoice data (XML) and receive a certified XML file (`Comprobante` including `TimbreFiscalDigital`).
*   **Document Management:**
    *   Generate and securely store both the certified XML and a standard PDF representation of invoices (including digital seals, QR codes, and a unique folio fiscal UUID).
    *   Allow easy retrieval, viewing, and downloading of stored documents.
*   **Modification & Cancellation:**
    *   Process requests for invoice cancellations according to SAT workflows (including cancellation reasons and potential replacement UUIDs).
    *   Handle issuance of credit/debit notes (`Nota de Crédito`/`Nota de Débito`) as related CFDIs, in full compliance with SAT guidelines.

#### B. Expense Management Module

*   **Expense Entry and Capture:**
    *   Enable users to enter expenses via a simple multi-step web form (date, description, amount, category, method of payment, project/tag).
    *   Support mobile capture: Allow users to upload receipt images (JPG, PNG, PDF) via smartphone or web.
    *   Integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to auto-populate data fields (vendor, date, amount, taxes) from uploaded receipts.
*   **Approval Workflow:**
    *   Include configurable multi-level approval routes based on criteria like amount, department, category, or project.
    *   Trigger notifications (email, in-app) to approvers.
    *   Record approval/rejection comments and maintain a clear audit trail.
*   **Reporting & Analytics:**
    *   Offer dashboards displaying key expense metrics (total spend, spend by category/period).
    *   Provide detailed, filterable reports showing expense trends, category breakdowns, variance from budget (future), and per-project spending.

#### C. Automation & Integration Module

*   **MCP Endpoint Connectivity:**
    *   Expose a standardized set of API endpoints following the Modular Connection Protocol (MCP) specification to facilitate seamless integration with workflow automation platforms (e.g., n8n, Make, Zapier).
    *   Provide connectors or trigger nodes (for platforms like n8n) that allow external tools to:
        *   Push new invoice data (pre-timbrado) or expense records into the system.
        *   Retrieve status updates (e.g., invoice timbrado result, cancellation status, expense approval status).
        *   Trigger workflows based on events within the platform (e.g., Invoice Certified, Expense Approved).
*   **RESTful API & Webhooks:**
    *   Offer traditional RESTful API endpoints (documented via OpenAPI spec) for broader integration scenarios beyond MCP.
    *   Provide a robust webhook system for real-time event notifications (e.g., `invoice.certified`, `invoice.cancelled`, `expense.approved`, `expense.rejected`) to subscribed external systems.
*   **Integration with Third-Party Systems:**
    *   Support connectivity with other financial or ERP solutions via documented APIs, enabling two-way synchronization of data where applicable (e.g., syncing clients, approved expenses).
