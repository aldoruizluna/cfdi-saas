# Infrastructure

This directory contains code and configuration for defining, deploying, and managing the cloud infrastructure required to run the SaaS platform.

## Approach: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

We use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to ensure that our infrastructure is version-controlled, repeatable, and automated. This reduces manual errors and improves consistency across environments.

## Technology Choice

*   **IaC Tool:** Terraform (Primary choice for this example)
*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS (Example - could be Azure, GCP)
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (e.g., AWS EKS, self-managed K8s)
*   **Container Registry:** AWS ECR (Example)
*   **Databases:** AWS RDS (PostgreSQL), AWS DocumentDB/MongoDB Atlas (Example)
*   **Blob Storage:** AWS S3
*   **Messaging:** AWS MQ (RabbitMQ) / AWS SQS+SNS (Example)
*   **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault

## Directory Structure (`terraform/`)

*   **`modules/`:** Reusable Terraform modules for common infrastructure components (e.g., VPC, Kubernetes Cluster, RDS Database, S3 Bucket, IAM Roles). This promotes DRY principles.
*   **`environments/`:** Environment-specific configurations (e.g., `staging`, `production`). Each environment directory contains Terraform configuration (`.tf` files) that instantiates the modules with environment-specific parameters (instance sizes, domain names, replica counts).
    *   `staging/`: Configuration for the staging/testing environment.
    *   `production/`: Configuration for the production environment.
*   **`main.tf`:** Root configuration defining providers (AWS) and potentially backend state configuration (e.g., using an S3 bucket for Terraform state).
*   **`variables.tf`:** Common input variables.
*   **`outputs.tf`:** Outputs generated after applying configuration (e.g., Load Balancer DNS names, K8s cluster endpoint).

## Getting Started (Infrastructure Deployment)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Terraform CLI installed ([Download Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)).
    *   Cloud Provider CLI installed and configured (e.g., `aws configure` with appropriate credentials).
    *   Access permissions to manage resources in the target cloud account.
2.  **Navigate:** `cd infrastructure/terraform/environments/[target-environment]` (e.g., `cd infrastructure/terraform/environments/staging`).
3.  **Initialize:** `terraform init` (Downloads providers and modules).
4.  **Plan:** `terraform plan -out=tfplan` (Shows changes to be made - review carefully!).
5.  **Apply:** `terraform apply tfplan` (Applies the changes to create/update infrastructure).
6.  **Destroy (Use with caution!):** `terraform destroy` (Tears down infrastructure managed by this configuration).

**Note:** Managing infrastructure requires significant care, especially in production. Ensure you understand the changes proposed by `terraform plan` before applying. Use state locking and secure state management practices.

## CI/CD Integration

The CI/CD pipelines defined in `../../.github/workflows/` should integrate with Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning and updates as part of the deployment process, ideally with manual approval steps for production environments.
