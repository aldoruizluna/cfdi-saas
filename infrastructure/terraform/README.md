# Terraform Configuration

This directory contains the Terraform code used to provision and manage the cloud infrastructure for the SaaS platform on [Target Cloud Provider - e.g., AWS].

## Structure

*   **`modules/`:** Contains reusable Terraform modules for creating components like VPCs, Kubernetes clusters, databases, etc. See the README within `modules/` for details on available modules.
*   **`environments/`:** Contains the root configurations for each deployment environment (e.g., `staging`, `production`). These configurations utilize the shared modules.
    *   Each environment directory manages its own Terraform state, ensuring isolation.
*   **`main.tf`:** Defines the required Terraform version and configures the backend for remote state storage (e.g., AWS S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for state locking). It also defines provider configuration (e.g., AWS region).
*   **`variables.tf`:** Defines input variables used across the configurations. Sensitive variables should not have defaults here.
*   **`outputs.tf`:** Defines outputs from the root configuration (less common here, more often in environment-specific or module outputs).

## Backend State

Terraform state is stored remotely and securely using [e.g., AWS S3 with DynamoDB for locking] to enable collaboration and prevent conflicts. The configuration for the backend is defined in `main.tf`. Ensure the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table are created *before* running `terraform init` for the first time (this might be done manually or via a separate small Terraform config).

## Usage

1.  Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites (Terraform CLI, Cloud Provider CLI configured).
2.  Navigate to the specific environment directory you want to manage: `cd environments/[staging|production]`
3.  Run `terraform init` to initialize the backend and download modules/providers.
4.  Run `terraform plan -var-file="[environment].tfvars"` (if using `.tfvars` files for secrets/variables) to preview changes.
5.  Run `terraform apply "[plan_file]"` or `terraform apply -var-file="[environment].tfvars"` to apply the changes.
