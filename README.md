# SaaS Invoicing & Expense Management Platform (Codename: FinMex Suite - Example)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the cloud-based SaaS platform providing electronic invoicing (CFDI 4.0 compliant), expense management, and automation integration capabilities (MCP) for the Mexican market.

The platform is designed as a multi-tenant solution using a microservices architecture. It aims to simplify financial administration for businesses operating in Mexico.

Refer to the [Full Software Specification](./docs/SPECIFICATION.md) (assuming you place the original spec document here) for complete details.

## Key Features (Full Scope)

*   **Invoicing Module (CFDI Manager):** CFDI 4.0 generation, validation, PAC `timbrado`, cancellation, document storage (XML/PDF).
*   **Expense Management Module:** Manual entry, mobile capture with OCR, configurable approval workflows, reporting & analytics.
*   **Automation & Integration Module:** MCP endpoints for n8n/automation platforms, REST APIs, Webhooks, third-party ERP integrations.

## Technology Stack (Planned - Example)

*   **Frontend:** React / TypeScript / Vite
*   **Backend:** Node.js / TypeScript / NestJS (adjust per service as needed)
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL (Transactional), MongoDB (Logging/Analytics)
*   **Infrastructure:** AWS / Kubernetes / Terraform
*   **Messaging:** RabbitMQ (Async tasks/notifications)
*   **API Gateway:** Kong / Custom Go service (Example)

## Folder Structure

*   `backend/`: Contains all microservices and the API Gateway.
*   `frontend/`: Contains the SPA web application.
*   `infrastructure/`: Infrastructure as Code definitions (Terraform).
*   `docs/`: All project documentation (architecture, API specs, guides).
*   `scripts/`: Utility scripts for development and operations.
*   `shared/`: Optional directory for code shared across services/apps.
*   `.github/`: CI/CD workflow definitions (GitHub Actions).

Refer to the `README.md` file within each directory for specific details.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

1.  **Prerequisites:** Node.js (vX.Y.Z), Docker, Docker Compose, [Any other specific tools like Terraform CLI, AWS CLI].
2.  **Clone:** `git clone [repository-url]`
3.  **Navigate:** `cd [repository-directory]`
4.  **Setup:** Run `scripts/setup-dev.sh` (Ensure this script exists and is executable). This should install dependencies and set up initial configurations.
5.  **Run:** `docker-compose up -d` (Based on the root `docker-compose.yml`). This should start all backend services, databases, and potentially the frontend dev server.

See the [Local Development Setup Guide](./docs/developer-guides/local-setup.md) for detailed instructions, environment variable setup, and troubleshooting.
